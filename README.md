## Introduction
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, we recommend using a good IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as PyCharm.

## Installing PyCharm

PyCharm comes in two versions: Professional and Community Edition. As a student, you may have access to a license for the Professional version, but we recommend using the Community Edition, which is open-source and free.

## Running the Test Script

To run the `test-script.py` file, you'll need to install the following libraries:

* **NumPy**: for numerical computations
* **Pandas**: for data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib**: for creating visualizations
* **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**: for machine learning tasks

## Installation Instructions (Windows)

1. Install Python from the official website.
2. Install PyCharm Community Edition from the JetBrains website.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
4. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the `test-script.py` file using PyCharm or by executing it from the command line.
